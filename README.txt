Compiled with Visual Studio 2013.

HOW TO USE:

The mouse pointer simulates a touch screen interface. Click things with the mouser pointer.
Several physical actions are simulation throughout. They are as follows:
 - Press 's' on the login screen to simulate swiping or inserting a card
 - Simulate depositing cheques and cash with text entry
 - Printing of receipts simulated with message boxes
There is no text entry or keyboard interaction outside of the simulated elements. 
 
KNOWN ISSUE:
- When switching from mode to mode, windows pop up and others close. These windows should always pop
  up in the same position, but they don't. This doesn't affect the UI/simulation. 
- Sometimes a window will not pop up at all, but will be opened minimized in the task bar.
- Closing any of the modes may not exit the application
- The Pay Bills function is severly unfinished. In fact it can't even be said to work.
